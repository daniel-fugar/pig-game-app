# Pig Game 🎲

A simple web app that simulates the **Pig Dice Game**, built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
I created this project to reinforce my understanding of the **DOM (Document Object Model)** and practice event handling in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5** – structure  
- **CSS3** – styling  
- **JavaScript (DOM manipulation)** – game logic and interactivity  

---

## 🎮 How to Play
- Players take turns rolling a dice.  
- Each roll adds to the current score unless a `1` is rolled (then the turn ends and the score resets).  
- A player can "Hold" to save their score.  
- First player to reach **100 points** wins the game.

## 📚 What I Practiced
- Selecting and manipulating DOM elements  
- Handling user events (clicks, button actions)  
- Updating the UI dynamically with JavaScript  
- Basic game logic and state management
